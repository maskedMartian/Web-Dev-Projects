			<h1>About us:</h1>
			<h4>We began over 256 solar cycles ago as a small one man operation. My great-great-great-great-great 
			granduncle started this pet supply company with a single class 069ss cyberspace ship and a 
			butterfly net. It was his passion for collecting rare and completely disgusting extraterrestrial 
			life, and selling them as pets to any sucker who was willing to shell out an extraordinary amount 
			of cash, that has driven this company forward ever since. Here at the maskedMartian's Interplanetary 
			Pet Emporium we take pride in what we do - at least that's what we tell our customers. Please look 
			around our website. Check out the new and strange pet possibilities. Hopefully you can find a new 
			life-long companion.  We assume you have taken the time to learn the proper handling techniques for 
			these exotic creatures. As such, Spacewares Unlimited and its subsidiaries cannot be held responsible 
			if your new pet decides to go on a blood-thirsty rampage and eats your entire family </h4>

				<p>"The Interstellar Pet Emporium is your first and only stop for all 
				of your exotic pet needs. We have been offering a large variety of beloved extraterrestrial 
				companions for over 256 solar cycles. We guarantee all our pets to be completely 
				hypoallergenic, free of alien viruses, and shipped, via cyberspace ship, anywhere in the 
				solar system within 64 lunar cycles after your order has been placed." </br> -Kreetoc of Gilderaan, CEO</p>
